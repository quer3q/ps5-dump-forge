//! In-place image edits with an undo journal: the engine every format editor's writes go through.
//!
//! A format editor (`edit::plan` in the exFAT, UFS2 and PFS crates) turns [`Op`]s into [`Write`]s
//! and reads the image only. [`apply`] then writes them crash-safely:
//!
//! 1. the old bytes of every `live` region (their union: live writes may overlap, each byte's
//!    original kept once) go to `<image file name>.forge-undo` beside the image (exclusive
//!    create), which is synced with its folder;
//! 2. the free-space writes, then an image sync;
//! 3. the live writes (metadata, in-place replacements) in the order given, then an image sync.
//!
//! [`Applied::commit`] deletes the journal; [`Applied::rollback`] restores the old bytes and
//! deletes it. A journal left by a crash is handled by [`recover`], which every open of an image
//! for editing calls first: a complete journal is restored then deleted, an incomplete one (the
//! crash came before any live write) only deleted. Free space keeps whatever the free-space
//! writes put there: nothing references it once the live regions are restored.
//!
//! Journal layout, little-endian: `FORGEUNDO1`, the image length (u64), the journal's own length
//! (u64), the entry count (u32); per entry its offset (u64), length (u64) and old bytes; then the
//! trailer: `FORGEEND` and a CRC-32 of everything before the CRC. A journal that doesn't end with
//! the trailer and is shorter than its header declares (or than a header) was cut short before it
//! was synced (so before any live write) and is deleted; any other that fails a check (its CRC,
//! its declared length either way, an entry) is damage: an error, the journal kept.
