//! `naps_pkg_layout.dat`: the map from the on-disk inner image to the mount.
//!
//! Layout (validated by parsing `webbrowser.pkg`'s 432-byte file exactly):
//!
//! * 16-byte header of two little-endian words —
//!   `{numFiles-1:24, compType:2, numKeys-1:2, numShuffle:4, numUBlocks:24}` and
//!   `{numOuterBlocks:24, numCblockInfo-2:24}`.
//! * Sections in fixed order with fixed strides: outer-block digests (8 B), shuffle
//!   patterns (8 B), `fidx` (6 B: 40-bit little-endian offset + a 1-byte type, the last
//!   entry the mount size with type `0x40`), `u2c` mapping (10 B: uint24 base plus seven
//!   per-ublock deltas), `cblockinfo` (9 B records, bit-packed).
//!
//! `cblockinfo` records are either run-base markers (`m_isRunBase` at bit 18, carrying the
//! AES-XTS tweak and key slot of an encrypted download run plus the base of its compressed
//! offset) or per-block records carrying the block's compressed offset, uncompressed offset,
//! first-sub-chunk compressed length, even/odd flags, the KDE predictor and a shuffle index.
//!
//! Every field of a record is written: the record packs all 72 bits, and a codec that leaves the
//! top nine at zero cannot reproduce a real descriptor's records — which is how the layout here
//! first went wrong, with the run-base window base truncated to 15 bits and the ninth byte, which
//! carries the high `kde` bits and the shuffle index, always zero.
//!
//! The header's `compType` is the codec for the whole image, and it carries the same algorithm ids
//! as the container header: 0 QuickZ, 1 Zlib, 2 Kraken. Each block record then says whether that
//! block carries a payload at all. A raw record carries one even chunk (`Even = 1`, with
//! `clen = min(len, 128 KiB) - 1`) and an odd chunk only when the unit is larger than the even
//! chunk, which is what the engine's raw-block path emits.
//!
//! A stored image still carries a run schedule: a run opens at every file's start — the compressed
//! cursor re-bases there — and `walk` opens one at every 16-record window, which the engine asserts
//! and without which a window has no anchor. The tail closes with a terminator, marked by bit 19 on
//! its record, without which the mount's own walk has no end.
