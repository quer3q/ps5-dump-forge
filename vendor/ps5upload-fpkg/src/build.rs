//! The build pipeline: a source folder to a verified `.pkg`.
//!
//! One sequential pass over the source bytes: sizes come from `stat`, the plan fixes every
//! offset before the first read, and each file is read once while its image is filled. The
//! output lands as `<name>.pkg.partial`, is verified by this crate's own reader, and is
//! only then renamed.
//!
//! [`build`] is [`prepare`] then [`write_package`] around that output transaction. A caller
//! that has its own (an already-open [`source::SourceTree`], its own temporary name, fsync and
//! publish) calls the two directly.
